## Exercises from Learn Python The Hard Way, 3rd Edition

This repository contains files with code from the exercises in **"Learn Python 
The Hard Way"** book (3rd Edition). It also contains files with solutions to 
the study drills mentioned in each exercise.

Pls. note that the solutions are **not** any official versions published by the 
Author Zed A. Shaw. I came up with them during the course of my learning from 
the book and I have posted them for interested readers. 

Hope it helps. And, sorry for any typos.
